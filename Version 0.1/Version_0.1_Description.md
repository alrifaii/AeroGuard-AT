# Flask Map Zone Check - Version 1.0

This project runs a Flask web application that continuously generates random coordinates within a defined radius. It then displays these locations on a map along with timestamps and permission statuses. Shows historical flight paths with color-coded connections (green for permitted flights, red for restricted zones).
